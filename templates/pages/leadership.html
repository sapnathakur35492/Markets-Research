                </li>
                <li><strong>Evidence before assertion</strong> — claims must be supported by validated data.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence before influence</strong> — analysis is insulated from commercial pressure.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality before convenience</strong> — client data protection is non-negotiable.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency before scale</strong> — methodological consistency is prioritized over rapid
                    expansion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Institutional Culture</h2>
            <p>Leadership at Markets NXT promotes a culture of analytical discipline, professional skepticism, and
                continuous improvement. Internal debate, peer review, and methodological challenge are encouraged as
                mechanisms to improve research quality.</p>
