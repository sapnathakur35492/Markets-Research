            <h2>2. No Advisory Relationship Created by Content Access</h2>
            <p>Accessing Markets NXT Content, purchasing research reports, attending briefings, or communicating with
                our analysts does not by itself create a formal consulting, advisory, fiduciary, or client relationship.
            </p>
            <p>A formal advisory relationship exists only where a written consulting or engagement agreement has been
                executed between Markets NXT and the client organization. Absent such an agreement, users should not
                rely on Content as personalized advisory guidance.</p>

            <h2>3. Methodology-Based Estimates & Forecasts</h2>
            <p>Many Markets NXT research publications include: Market size estimates, Growth projections, Forecast
                models, Scenario analyses, Trend outlooks.</p>
            <p>These are developed using structured methodologies, stated assumptions, historical patterns, and
                available data sources. However, all forward-looking analysis inherently involves uncertainty. Actual
                outcomes may differ materially due to factors including but not limited to: Macroeconomic shifts, Policy
                and regulatory changes, Competitive actions, Technology disruption, Supply chain variability, Capital
                market behavior, Geopolitical developments. Forecasts and projections are not guarantees of future
                performance.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Sources & Reliability Limitations</h2>
            <p>Markets NXT research draws from a combination of primary and secondary sources, which may include: Public

                statistics, Proprietary analytical models.</p>
            <p>While we apply structured validation and cross-verification processes, we do not independently audit
                every external data source used. Accordingly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not guarantee absolute accuracy of all source data</li>

            </ul>
